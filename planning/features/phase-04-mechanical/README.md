# Phase 4: mechanical

DATE: 2026-10-21
STATUS: Scoped. Interviewed (equipment shared shape, Ventilators, hot water) and planned as P4-01 to P4-15 on 2026-10-21; families 3 to 7, piping and ducting are gate stubs until their interviews; D4-01 to D4-12 answered as recommended the same day; no stage authorized.
AUTHOR: Ed May, BLDGTYP, with Claude
ISSUE: none (local planning draft)

Roadmap items 4.1 to 4.6 from [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md). Author the equipment a Phius model
needs and the Zones each item serves, then draw and measure the ducts and pipes, so METr needs no
hand entry before its first run. Phase 4 closing is the complete MVP Ed set in D1.

This directory is the phase's coordinating packet (`planning/.instructions.md`). The three feature
packets inside it hold the behavior and the interview records; the coordinating files hold the
stages, the bindings, the open decisions and the one ledger.

## Read order

1. [equipment/PRD.md](equipment/PRD.md): the shared shape, seven families and the interview
   record (Q1 to Q12, V1 to V6, hot water H1 to H7). Then the
   [hot-water-piping](hot-water-piping/PRD.md) and [erv-ducting](erv-ducting/PRD.md) PRDs, not yet
   interviewed.
2. [STATUS.md](STATUS.md): the tracking ledger. One row per stage, the entry gates, the decisions
   and what each stage still owes. The one place completeness is read from.
3. [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md): what the code and the stack say beyond the PRDs (F1 to F14) and
   the twelve plan decisions D4-01 to D4-12, answered as recommended on 2026-10-21.
4. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md): the stages, their order, owners, gates and the files shared with Phase 3b.
5. [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md): feature id, records, operations, seams, foundation additions A1
   to A5, findings and the export sections. Proposed until P4-01 confirms them against code.
6. [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md): M01 to M15 and the synthetic reference model with its expected
   HBJSON.
7. The stage document being worked, under [phases/](phases). Each full document is written to be
   handed to a coding agent on its own, with this packet's CONTRACTS and the equipment PRD. A gate
   stub says what must happen before it can be written in full.

## Stages

| Stage | Delivers |
| --- | --- |
| [P4-01](phases/p4-01-equipment-contracts-and-seams.md) | Contracts confirmed against code; `honeybee_phhvac` through the Pyodide seam; citation lint |
| [P4-02](phases/p4-02-equipment-feature-and-ventilator-kind.md) | The feature and the Ventilator kind with its operations, panel closed |
| [P4-03](phases/p4-03-serves-assignment.md) | The Serves record on the Zone Group, its target, assign and clear, the Zone-copy contributor |
| [P4-04](phases/p4-04-ventilator-export.md) | The ventilation contributor and section; the B4 HBJSON proof |
| [P4-05](phases/p4-05-systems-tab-and-ventilators-view.md) | The Systems tab, the Equipment subtab, the Ventilators view with Serves and balance, `By ventilator` |
| [P4-06](phases/p4-06-hot-water-records-and-export.md) | The Hot Water System kind with tanks and heaters, and its section |
| [P4-07](phases/p4-07-hot-water-view.md) | The Hot water view with child rows, `By hot water system` |
| [P4-08](phases/p4-08-heat-pumps.md), [P4-09](phases/p4-09-electric-heaters.md), [P4-10](phases/p4-10-pumps.md), [P4-11](phases/p4-11-fans.md), [P4-12](phases/p4-12-appliances.md) | Families 3 to 7, each after its interview |
| [P4-13](phases/p4-13-hot-water-piping.md), [P4-14](phases/p4-14-erv-ducting.md) | The drawn packets, after Phase 3b's edge stages and their interviews |
| [P4-15](phases/p4-15-acceptance-and-handoff.md) | Integrated acceptance, context, docs, the metr-export handoff; the phase close |

## What this packet needs from elsewhere

- Phase 3b, in progress since 2026-10-21: its lint, composition-root, `index.html` and assembly
  edits land before the Phase 4 stage that touches the same file (PLAN, "Order and parallel
  work"); its edge stages P3b-03 to P3b-08 before P4-13 and P4-14.
- [metr-export](../unscheduled/metr-export/README.md) for every METr claim; acceptance here is
  HBJSON reloaded in the pinned stack.
- [honeybee_ph#135](https://github.com/PH-Tools/honeybee_ph/issues/135) for the simplified hot
  water methods.
- [units](../cross-phase/units/STATUS.md) Q2 and Q3 for the new quantity rows.

## Scope

In: the seven equipment families as records with a Serves relation to Zones, the Systems tab,
Colour-by modes, findings and HBJSON export; ERV ducting and hot water piping as drawn edges with
types, schedules and export, once Phase 3b supplies the edge mechanics.

Out: METr conversion, the simplified hot water methods until upstream carries the field, boilers,
district heat and PV, equipment libraries, the Zone loads packet's loads, equipment geometry,
sizing, schedules, SketchUp 2023 and Windows proof, public distribution.

## Rules for every stage

- The PRD owns behavior, CONTRACTS binds names, the stage document sequences the work. A stage
  that needs a behavior the PRD does not state stops and records the question in DECISIONS.
- Code and tests cite `context/` and never `planning/`, a PRD or a planning id. `make lint`
  enforces it. Durable rules a stage settles are folded into `context/` in the same change.
- Before designing a boundary or changing code, load
  `.agents/skills/ph-composer-architecture-review/SKILL.md`. Before changing an HtmlDialog screen,
  load `.agents/skills/ph-composer-ui-polish/SKILL.md` and read the screen's table in
  [ui-baseline](../../ui-baseline/README.md).
- Link measured host claims to current host evidence. Do not restate them.
- Tests come first and are listed in each stage. Offline tests never stand in for a host gate. A
  stage is `Implemented on branch` only after its host gate has run, following
  `.agents/skills/ph-composer-native-acceptance/SKILL.md`.
- Synthetic fixtures only. No client data, no licensed tables, no real project model.
- Every commit carries a DCO sign-off.
- When a stage changes state, update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) in the same change.
