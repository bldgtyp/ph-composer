"""The one place the package imports honeybee, ladybug or PHX.

Nothing is imported when a module of this package is imported: every module must import without the
stack (tests/python/test_imports.py), so the contract layer runs under pytest alone and nothing runs
before the runtime has installed the wheels. A section calls `load` inside `translate`.

This build ships no wheels. `load` then raises `StackUnavailable`, which names the missing module.
